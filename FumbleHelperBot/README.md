# FumbleHelper

A personal Discord bot designed for my Discord server, Succ's Chilly Cave.

Currently, the bot is private and exclusive to the aforementioned server.

There is a possibility that it may become public and accessible to everyone in the future.

While the bot is technically open source, as in you can freely read all the code it's important to note that this doesn't grant permission for anyone to indiscriminately copy and use it as their own.

## Future Plans
- Web panel
- Permission handler
- Automod
- Manual Moderation x
- Reaction roles
- GiveawayBot
- Ticket tool
